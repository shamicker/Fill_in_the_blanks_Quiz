# Reverse Mad-Libs (Fill-in-the-blanks)
### Udacity IPND Project #2

For this project, you'll be building Reverse Mad-Libs. You play Reverse Mad-Libs by reading a sentence with blanks in it and then filling in the blanks appropriately. This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

Once you've created the game according to the rubric specification below you should save your python file (named <code>reverse-mad-libs.py</code>). You should ask reviewers to provide feedback on two aspects of your submission: the game itself and the Python code you've written.

### 1 - Game Review
In this portion of the review, your reviewer will be checking to make sure the game works the way it's supposed to. See the rubric below for exact specs.

### 2 - Code Review
Your reviewer will also look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:

- **Use of Variables**: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable **names** should reflect the **values** they store.

- **Functions**: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.

- **Appropriate use of Data**: Data types (<code>strings</code> vs <code>lists</code> for example) should be used appropriately.

- **Appropriate use of other coding techniques**: Your code should use statements like <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, etc... appropriately.


Rubrics you should use are included below:
