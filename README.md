#### Udacity IPND Project #2

By the end of this stage, you will be able to use other people's existing code in your own programming projects. You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

### How will I complete this project?

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

- Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.

- To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py) - this module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.

- Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.

Get started with this helpful [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyjtEVPxDqmDHs6Gl9vZsD04TWkX0tWKyMDZkHAK33Y/pub?embedded=true).

For this stage, you should share a zip of your project files saved as <code>movie_website.zip</code>. Your zip should include three Python files: <code>media.py</code>, <code>entertainment_center.py</code>, and <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code>. 
Use the following rubric to evaluate your work:
